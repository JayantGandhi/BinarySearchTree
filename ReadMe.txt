Binary Search Tree (BST)

Program where I implemented the Binary Search Tree data structure.
Takes two input files (one of Ints and one of Chars) - see sample files for format.
Inputs information from files into a BST.
Prints out data using preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal.
Finds and deletes elements of the BST.
